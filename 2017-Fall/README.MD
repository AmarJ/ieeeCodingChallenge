# IEEE Coding Challenge Fall 2017! 

## Challenge Rules

- Participants must work individually. 
- Participants will have exactly 1 hour to complete the challenge.
- You may use any programming language.

Solutions will be judged based on algorithm efficiency and the time it takes to complete the challenge. Although a question might look trivial keep in mind that there is a brute force solution and an efficient one.

## Instructions for submission 

You will have 5 minutes after the challenge is over to submit your code via email. 

You must name your files like this:

"Q" followed by the question number followed by "_" and your student number.  

For example: **Q1_XXXXXXX.py** -- where the XXXXXXX represents your student number.

Send your files to academic@ieeeuottawa.ca with the following in the email subject. 

**Subject:** [Year] - [Student Number] - [Completed questions]

For example: **2 - 8668550 - 1,2,3**

Good luck and have fun!
